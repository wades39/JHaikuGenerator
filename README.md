## VERSION HISTORY
### Version:  0.6.5
As of Nov. 6, 2019, the program has most of the objects and code which it needs to function. However, that code has not been implemented such that it would function.

### Version:  0.8.0
As of Nov. 9, 2019, the program's code has been implemented in such a way that it improves performace. However, there is a known issue where words are truncated by the code when attempting to generate poems. The progress bar component still needs to be implemented as a representation of the program's progress in generating the poem.
